  ## Description
   This challenge was used to help me develop my skills with debugging and optimizing CSS organization. 

  ## Usage
  This page does not serve too much value to the user, it mostly serves as a well designed landing page for a company called Horiseon that helped me to develop a better understanding of CSS and how to write it in an organized and logical way.
